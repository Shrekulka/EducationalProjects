The provided code is a Python script that establishes a TCP connection to a server, sends data to the server, receives 
a response, and then prints the received data.

Here's a breakdown of how the code works:

1. The `connect_to_server` function is defined, which takes `target_host` and `target_port` as input parameters. This 
   function handles the connection to the server and sending/receiving data.

2. Inside the `connect_to_server` function:
   - A socket object named `client` is created using `socket.socket`.
   - The client socket is connected to the target host and port using `client.connect((target_host, target_port))`.
   - User input is taken to get data to send to the server.
   - The input data is encoded as bytes using `data_to_send.encode()` and sent to the server using `client.send()`.
   - A byte object named `data` is created to store the received data.
   - The function enters a loop where it receives data from the server in chunks of up to 4096 bytes using 
     `client.recv(4096)`. The received data is added to the `data` object.
   - The loop continues until there is no more data to receive (when `response` is empty).
   - Finally, the received data is returned after decoding it from bytes to a UTF-8 encoded string using 
     `data.decode("utf-8")`.

3. The `main` function is defined, which serves as the entry point of the script.
   - The `target_host` is set to `"localhost"` and the `target_port` is set to `5050`.
   - The `connect_to_server` function is called with the target host and port as arguments, and the received data is 
     stored in the `received_data` variable.
   - The received data is printed.

4. The `main` function is called only if the script is run directly (not imported as a module).

To use this code, you need to provide the appropriate `target_host` and `target_port` values. The `target_host` should 
be the hostname or IP address of the server you want to connect to, and the `target_port` should be the port number on 
which the server is listening for connections.


To use this code, you will need to complete the following steps:

1. Set target host and port: The target_host and target_port variables are defined in the code. Replace the values of 
   these with the appropriate host and port that you want to connect to.
2. Run the script: Save the file and run it using a Python interpreter. The script will establish a connection to the 
   specified host and port, send data to the server, accept the response, and display it on the screen.
3. Enter data to send: After running the script you will be prompted to enter the data that will be sent to the 
   server. Enter the required data and press Enter.
4. Wait for response: After sending the data, the script will wait for a response from the server. When the response is 
   received, it will be displayed.

Important: 
Make sure that the target server is available and running on the specified host and port. Otherwise, the script may not 
establish a connection or get an error when sending data.

This is the basic process of using this code. You can customize the code and make changes to fit your needs and 
requirements for communicating with the server.
