# This code represents the structure of a Django application for creating a website with information about zodiac signs 
# and horoscopes. It provides URL routing, defines data models for zodiac signs, and offers views to display information.

## Main tasks:
1. Define the URL structure for different pages of the site.
2. Create a data model to store information about zodiac signs.
3. Handle requests and display relevant information about zodiac signs.
4. Provide the ability to search for a zodiac sign by date or number.
5. Group zodiac signs by elements (fire, earth, air, water).

## Code execution sequence:
1. When the Django application starts, it first loads the configuration from zodiac_portal/zodiac_portal/urls.py, which 
   defines the root URL routes.
2. Then, it loads the URL routes from zodiac_portal/horoscope/urls.py, which define specific paths for the horoscope 
   application.
3. The ZodiacSign model in models.py defines the data structure for each zodiac sign.
4. The ZodiacSigns class initializes all zodiac signs and provides methods to work with them.
5. When a user accesses a specific URL, Django calls the corresponding view from views.py.
6. The views process the request, obtain the necessary data from ZodiacSigns, and return an HTTP response.

## Code features:
1. Use of classes for data structuring: ZodiacSign for individual signs and ZodiacSigns for managing all signs.
2. Use of URL reversing with reverse() to create dynamic links.
3. Special handling for the Capricorn sign, which crosses the year boundary.
4. Grouping signs by elements using a dictionary called types.
5. Ability to get a zodiac sign by date, number, or name.
6. Use of HttpResponseRedirect to redirect the user to the zodiac sign information page.
7. Generation of HTML markup directly in views (this can be improved by using Django templates).
8. HoroscopeConfig configuration class for setting up the application, including a human-readable name in Russian.
