# Descriptions of solutions for each task:

1) `count_gas_stations_not_only_marked_with_a_dot`
### Goal: Count the number of gas stations (petrol stations) on the OSM map that are tagged with amenity=fuel.

### Solution Steps:
- Import libraries: `requests` for HTTP requests and `xmltodict` for converting XML to a dictionary.
- Fetch data: Obtain the XML file of the OSM map from the given URL.
- Check request success: If the status code is 200, proceed. Otherwise, print an error message.
- Parse XML: Convert the XML to a Python dictionary using `xmltodict`.
- Initialize counter: Create a variable `petrol_count` to count gas stations.
- Iterate over nodes and ways: Go through all nodes and ways in the dictionary and check tags.
- Check tags: If the `amenity` tag has the value `fuel`, increment the `petrol_count`.
- Print result: Output the number of found gas stations.

2) `count_shops_on_the_map`
### Goal: Count the number of shops on the OSM map and group them by type.

### Solution Steps:
- Import libraries: `requests`, `xmltodict`, and `defaultdict` from `collections`.
- Fetch data: Obtain the XML file of the OSM map from the given URL.
- Check request success: If successful, proceed with processing.
- Parse XML: Convert the XML to a dictionary using `xmltodict`.
- Initialize counters: Create dictionaries to store information about shop types and names.
- Iterate over nodes: Go through all nodes on the map.
- Find shop tags: Check tags for the `shop` key and add information to dictionaries.
- Print results: Output the total number of shops and information about shop types and names.

3) `number_of_petrol_stations_on_the_map`
### Goal: Count the number of gas stations (petrol stations) on the OSM map, similar to the first solution but without 
### considering ways.

### Solution Steps:
- Import libraries: `requests` and `xmltodict`.
- Fetch data: Obtain the XML file of the OSM map from the given URL.
- Check request success: If successful, proceed with processing.
- Parse XML: Convert the XML to a dictionary using `xmltodict`.
- Initialize counter: Create a variable `petrol_count` to count gas stations.
- Iterate over nodes: Go through all nodes in the dictionary.
- Check tags: If the `amenity` tag has the value `fuel`, increment the `petrol_count`.
- Print result: Output the number of found gas stations.

4) `tag_count`
### Goal: Count the number of nodes with tags and without tags on the OSM map.

### Solution Steps:
- Import libraries: `requests` and `xmltodict`.
- Fetch data: Obtain the XML file of the OSM map from the given URL.
- Check request success: If successful, proceed with processing.
- Parse XML: Convert the XML to a dictionary using `xmltodict`.
- Initialize counters: Create variables to count nodes with tags and without tags.
- Iterate over nodes: Go through all nodes and check for the presence of tags.
- Increment counters: Update counters based on the presence of tags.
- Print results: Output the count of nodes with tags and without tags.

5) `value_of_colors_of_pyramid_of_cubes_in_XML_format`
### Goal: Calculate the values of cubes by color in a pyramid represented in XML format.

### Solution Steps:
- Import library: Use `xml.etree.ElementTree` for XML processing.
- Define function: Create a `calculate_values` function that recursively traverses the cube tree and calculates the 
  value of each color.
- Process XML: Convert the XML string to an element using `ET.fromstring`.
- Call function: Invoke the `calculate_values` function for the root element and print the result.
- Alternative solution: A more compact implementation using the `getcubes` function.

## These solutions enable efficient processing of XML data in various formats and addressing tasks related to map and 
## hierarchical data analysis.
