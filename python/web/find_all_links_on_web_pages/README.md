The code is designed to analyze a web page on the Russian Wikipedia, extract internal and external links, and display 
them in a readable format. It utilizes the requests, BeautifulSoup, and urllib.parse libraries.

###First Solution:

1. Sends a GET request to the web page.
2. Parses the HTML code using BeautifulSoup.
3. Extracts all links (<a> tags) on the page.
4. Separates internal and external links by checking for the presence of a domain in the URL.
5. Prints a list of internal and external links, decoding URL-encoded characters.

###Second Solution:

1. Sends a GET request to the web page.
2. Parses the HTML code using BeautifulSoup.
3. Extracts all links (<a> tags) on the page.
4. Separates internal and external links by checking for the presence of a domain in the URL.
5. Stores internal and external links in a defaultdict(set) dictionary.
6. Prints a list of internal and external links from the dictionary, decoding URL-encoded characters.

Both solutions perform similar tasks, separating links into internal and external ones, and then displaying the results
in a readable format, but they use different data structures to store the information.
